# Business cockpit

The *VanillaBP business cockpit* is a UI for business people to work with business processes. It is about:

1. Process instances (= workflow)
     1. Search for workflows by business data
     1. View active and retired workflows
1. User tasks
     1. Search for user tasks by business data
     1. List active and retried user tasks
     1. Fulfill user tasks

Like [VanillaBP](https://www.vanillabp.io) itself was designed to be [BPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management)-agnostic, also *VanillaBP business cockpit* is able act as a UI for any BPMS. This also makes it possible to display workflows and user tasks from different systems in one user interface.
